## Welcome

Welcome to Typerocket ðŸ‘‹,

TypeRocket is a modern MVC and UI framework for WordPress. Crafted to save you hours of WordPress development time without sacrificing performance or user experience. Whatever you want to develop TypeRocket can help you make it fast and beautiful.

To help you get started, we put together this step-by-step guide.

## Installation Types

In the spirit of WordPress, TypeRocket is extremely flexible. To give you the greatest level of control, this flexibility extends to the installation process. The installation choices are numerous:

- Basic Plugin (recommended)
- MU Plugin
- Theme
- Composer
- And more...

The installation freedom you have means you can get TypeRocket working on virtually any **PHP 7.4+** server or **WordPress 6.0** setup.

## How Should You Install TypeRocket?

If you are new to TypeRocket, we recommend the "Basic Plugin" installation type of the [Pro plugin](/pro). You will get setup in minutes. If you opt **not** to go with the "Basic Plugin" installation, we recommend using the "Basic Plugin" installation first to get a feel for TypeRocket before using the others.

To install TypeRocket as a "Basic Plugin" we put together some quick videos to help you get started.

- [Free Plugin: Free Features Only](https://youtu.be/JNbSneZXBm4)

With TypeRocket installed you are almost ready to start coding. The last step is to create your application override folders within your active theme. The override folders are used to store your custom code (if your theme auto updates be careful no to lose your code during an update). Depending on your needs your code could be controllers, models, views, or other PHP classes.

We recommend downloading and installing [the official TypeRocket starter theme](https://github.com/TypeRocket/theme) for new projects. You will need to install the TypeRocket override folders for the theme to work.

Take a moment to [watch the TypeRocket tutorial on the override folders](https://youtu.be/tXPn7wUfBdo).
