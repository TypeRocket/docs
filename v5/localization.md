Title: Localization
Description: Localization of TypeRocket

---

Localization in TypeRocket is a mixture of generating a POT file and then manually updating that file. If you have manually updated the POT file, keep in mind regenerating the file will remove your edits.

If you are using WPML or another plugin, you will need to manually edit POT files for your fields, custom post types, and other places.

TypeRocket provides limited static strings for translation because of its dynamic nature.

*Note: Localization is being enhanced in the future v1.1 release, and manual POT file editing will still be required. However, there will be much better targeting in the new version.*
