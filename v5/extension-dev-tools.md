5. List of roles registered to WordPress.
6. Capabilities applied to WordPress roles.

## Toolbar

The `DevTools` extension also adds a toolbar to the bottom of every page is `WP_DEBUG` is set to `true`.

From the toolbar, you can view all of your database queries is you have `define('SAVEQUERIES', true);` in your `wp-config.php`.

Also, you can quickly flush the WordPress rewrite rules from the toolbar by clicking the "Flush Rules" tab.
