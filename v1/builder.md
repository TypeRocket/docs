Title: Page Builder for WordPress
Description: Build modular designs in a slide deck style. 

---

## Enable Page Builder

By default, the Page Builder will be the default editor for WordPress pages. To replace it with Gutenberg, add the following to your `wp-config.php` file.

```php
define('TR_PAGE_BUILDER', false);
```

## About Page Builder

The page builder plugin helps developers and designers work together with clients to deliver the best experience when building [modular/component-based designs](http://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design).

## Basic Usage

For the most basic setup, duplicate your theme's current `page.php` template and rename it to `standard.php`. Now, in the `page.php` template file, use the page builder.

```php
<?php get_header();

if( tr_post_field("use_builder") == '1') {
    tr_components_field('builder');
} else {
    get_template_part('standard');
}

get_footer();
```

This code will use the old page template `standard.php` if the builder is not being used.

## Component Folders

There are three directories you need. The directories are: `resources/visuals/builder`, `resources/components/builder`, and `wordpress/assets/components/builder`.
1. The `resources/visuals/builder` directory is for adding the HTML for each component's front-end design.
2. The `resources/components/builder` directory is for adding the backend fields for each component. 
3. Finally, the `wordpress/assets/components/builder` directory is for the thumbnails of the components.

*Note: If you are using the official WordPress plugin you need to create these folders in your active theme.*

## Content Component

To get started, examine the content component. This will give you a deeper look at what is going on and just how easy builder modular designs can be.

### Backend Fields

First, look at the components backend `resources/visuals/builder/content.php`. Here you can see two fields. One for a headline and one for some content. Also, the `<h1>` tag gives the component its name in the WordPress admin.

```php
<h1>Content Component</h1>
<?php
echo $form->text('Headline');
echo $form->editor('Content');
```

*Note: the `$form` variable is added for you and is an instance of the `TypeRocketElementsForm` class.*

### Thumbnail

To make the builder admin slide resemble the look of the component you, a thumbnail has been added at `wordpress/assets/components/builder/content.png`. Thumbnails can be anything you like. In many cases, a screenshot of the design it implements is the way to go.

### Visual

Take a look at the content components visual. Here you can see that the fields from the backend are accessible through the `$data` variable. This is true for all visuals. 

```html
<div class="builder-content">
    <h2><?php echo esc_html($data['headline']); ?></h2>
    <hr />
    <?php echo tr_sanitize_editor($data['content']); ?>
</div>
```

## Adding Components

To add new components, follow the pattern of the included content component. It is that easy. Create a visual, fields component, and thumbnail in the builder folder of each location.

You can use the Galaxy CLI command `make:component`  to create your component files quickly.

```
php galaxy make:component builder "My Component Name"
```

This command will create two files in `builder` folders.

- `components/builder/my-component-name.php`
- `visuals/builder/my-component-name.php`

## Dynamic Thumbnails

You can dynamically set thumbnails using the `tr_builder_component_thumbnails` hook. This is helpful if a field setting within your component changes the visual representation of the component.

```php
$path = tr_cinfig('urls.components');
add_filter('tr_builder_component_thumbnails', function($thumbnail, $v, $type, $name) use($path) {

    if($v && $type == 'grid') {
        $cells = $v['cells_per_row'] ?: 4;
        $style = $v['style'] ?: 'default';
        $thumbnail = "$path/$name/$type-$cells-$style.png";
    }

    if($v && $type == 'feature') {
        $align = $v['align'] ?: 'right';
        $thumbnail = "$path/$name/$type-$align.png";
    }

    if($v && $type == 'benefits') {
        $align = $v['align'] ?: 'right';
        $style = $v['style'] ?: 'default';
        $thumbnail = "$path/$name/$type-$align-$style.png";
    }

    return $thumbnail;
}, 10, 5);
```
