## About Models

Models are object representations of database tables and how you want them to behave. For example, if you have a table called `wp_docs` with the columns `id` (primary), `version`, `title`, `json`, `created_at`, `modified_at`, and `slug` you can create a model to access and manipulate it.

## Making a Model

To create a model, use the galaxy command `make:model`. When making a model with the CLI, it can use one of three directives:

1. `base` - A model that represents any table in the database.
2. `post` - A model that represents a post type.
3. `term` - A model that represents a taxonomy term.

Both `post` and `term` are unique and should be used with care. In many cases, it is best to use the WordPress functions to deal with posts and terms, so the hooks of other plugins are fired as expected.

The `base` directive is the most useful and is for making a model that is connected to custom tables.

*Note: The Galaxy command-line tool is not available if you are using the official TypeRocket Framework 4 WordPRess plugin.*

### Command

Here is the syntax for making a model

```bash
make:model [-c|--controller] [--] <directive> <name> [<id>]
```

### Doc Example

To create a `Doc` model class, representing the table from the about section, run the command: 

```bash
php galaxy make:model base Doc
```

Here is the class it creates:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use TypeRocket\Models\Model;

class Doc extends Model
{
    protected $resource = 'docs';
}
```

## Model Class Template Code

There are three model classes you can work with: `Model`, `WPPost`, and `WPTerm`. It is best to use the Galaxy CLI to produce the template code for each of these types. However, you may want to make your models manually.

When making your models manually locate them in the `app/Models` directory.

### Base Model

```bash
php galaxy make:model base Doc
```

Will produce `app/Models/Doc.php`,

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use \TypeRocket\Models\Model;

class Doc extends Model
{
    protected $resource = 'docs';
}
```

### Post Model

```bash
php galaxy make:model post Doc
```

Will produce `app/Models/Doc.php`,

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use \TypeRocket\Models\WPPost;

class Doc extends WPPost
{
    protected $postType = 'doc';
}
```

### Term Model

```bash
php galaxy make:model term Version
```

Will produce `app/Models/Version.php`,

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use \TypeRocket\Models\WPTerm;

class Version extends WPTerm
{
    protected $taxonomy = 'version';
}
```

## Basic Examples

You can query the database and retrieve the model you want. When a list of multiple items is returned a `Results` collection is returned.

```php
$docs = (new Doc())->where('version', 'v1')->find();
```

You can also get a single item where the version is not `v1`.

```php
$doc = (new Doc())->where('version', '!=' ,'v1')->first();
```

And, where the ID is greater than 10.

```php
$doc = new Doc;
$doc->where('version', '!=' ,'v1')
$doc->where('id', '>' , 10);
$doc->first();
```

Or, a single `Doc` by ID.

```php
$doc = (new Doc())->find(1);
```

## Fillable

To make limit what fields can be saved without be explicitly set use the `$fillable` property.

```php
class Doc extends Model
{
    // ...

    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'json',
        'version',
        'slug'
    ];
}
```

## Guard

To restrict a set of fields that can not be saved without be explicitly set use the `$guard` property.

```php
class Doc extends Model
{
    // ...

    protected $guard = [
        'id',
        'created_at',
        'modified_at'
    ];
}
```

## Cast

To cast a property value when it is accessed, use the `$cast` property.

```php
class Doc extends Model
{
    // ...

    protected $cast = [
        'id' => 'int', // cast to integer
        'json' => 'array', // cast a json string to an array
    ];
}
```

## Format

To format a model's values before it is saved, use the `$format` property. Formating can be used to sanitize data being saved to the database.

```php
class Doc extends Model
{
    // ...

    protected $format = [
        'slug' => 'sanitize_title',
        'version' => 'static::sanitizeVersion'
    ];

    public static function sanitizeVersion( $value ) {
        return 'v' . filter_var($value, FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT);
    }
}
```

## Model Instance

To create a new model instance of the `Model` you want to work with.
```php
$doc = new Doc;
```

## Finding

There are nine find methods models can use: `findById`, `findAll`, `find`, `first`, `findOrNew`, `findOrCreate`, `findOrDie`,  `findFirstWhereOrNew`, and `findFirstWhereOrDie`.

To get one item by its primary column ID: 

```php
$doc->findById(1);
```

To get a list of all records: 

```php
$doc->findAll()->get();
```

To get a list of all records with specific IDs: 

```php
$doc->findAll([1,2,3])->get();
```

A shorthand for `findById` and `findAll`: 

```php
$doc->find([1,2,3]);
$doc->find(1);
```

To get one record by its primary column ID or get a new Model: 

```php
$doc->findOrNew(1);
```

To get one record by its primary column ID or create a new record: 

```php
$values = [
    'title' => 'Draft',
    'version' => 'v1',
];

$doc->findOrCreate(1, $values);
```

To get one record by its primary column ID or die with `wp_die`: 

```php
$doc->findOrDie(1);
```

To get the first record: 

```php
$doc->first();
```

To get the first record by where the version is `v1` or die with `wp_die`:

```php
$doc->findFirstWhereOrDie('version', 'v1');
```

To get the first record by where the version is `v1` or get new model:

```php
$doc->findFirstWhereOrNew('version', 'v1');
```

## Get

The `get()` method queries the database. If more than one result is queried a [results collection](/docs/v1/results-collection/) is returned.

```php
$result = $doc->select('id')->take(10)->get();
```

## Get Properties

The `getProperties()` method returns all the properties, also called fields, of a model.

```php
$fields = (new \App\Models\Post())->first()->getProperties();
```

## Has Properties

```php
(new \App\Models\Post())->hasProperties();
```

## Where

There are two `where` methods for models `where` and `orWhere`. These methods can be chained in any way you like.

```php
$doc->where('version', '!=' ,'v1')->orWhere('id', 10);
$doc->first();
```

And,

```php
$doc->where('version', '!=' ,'v1')->where('id', 10);
$doc->first();
```

### Grouped Where

You can also group where clauses.

```php
$where = [
    [
        'column' => 'ID',
        'operator' => '=',
        'value' => 1
    ],
    'OR',
    [
        'column' => 'ID',
        'operator' => '=',
        'value' => '2'
    ]
];

$doc->where($where);
```

### Where Meta

Models that have meta tables (`WPPost`, `WPUser`, `WPComment`, and `WPTerm`) can use the method `whereMeta()`. `whereMeta()` allows you to query the meta table of the model by the `meta_key` and `meta_value`.

```php
// short syntax for where feature meta value is not null
(new Post)->whereMeta('feature')
```

```php
// grouped meta query
(new Post)
    ->whereMeta([
        [
            'column' => 'feature',
            'operator' => '!=',
            'value' => null
        ],
        'AND',
        [
            'column' => 'video_url',
            'operator' => '!=',
            'value' => null
        ]
    ])
    ->get();
```

```php
// multiple meta queries
(new Post)
    ->whereMeta('video_url', 'like', 'https://facebook.com%')
    ->whereMeta('video_url', 'like', 'https://youtube.com%', 'OR')
    ->get();
```

## Take: Limit and Offset

To take a specific number of items, use the `take()` method. This method takes two arguments:

1. `$limit` - The number of items to take.
1. `$offset` - The number of items to offset.

```php
$result = $doc->findAll()->take(10, 10)->get();
```

## Order By

You can set the ordering of results with `orderBy()`. this method takes two arguments:

1. `$column` - The column to order by, the primary key is the default.
2. `$direction` - The direction or the ordering `ASC` (default) and `DESC`.

```php
$result = $doc->findAll()->orderBy('version', 'DESC')->get();
```

## Date Time

In some cases, you will want to get the current date-time for the MySQL database. You can use the `getDateTime()` method to access the current time in MySQL format.

```php
$time = $doc->getDateTime();
```

## Create

You can save any property explicitly set. Explicitly set properties ignore `$guard` and `$fillable`. To create a new row instance a model and explicitly set the values of the columns.


```php
$doc = new Doc;
$doc->title = 'My Title';
$doc->json = ['key'=> 'value'];
$doc->version = 'v1';
$doc->slug = $doc->title;
$doc->created_at = $doc->getDateTime();
$doc->modified_at = $doc->created_at;
$doc->create();
```


## Update

If your query has one result like with `findById()`, you can save any property explicitly set.

```php
$doc = (new Doc)->findById(1);
$doc->json = ['key'=> 'new value'];
$doc->modified_at = $doc->created_at;
$doc->update();
```

## Save

The `save()` method will detect if a model's primary key is set. If the key is set, it will run the `update()` method, and if not it will run the `create()` method.

## Delete

If your query has one result like with `findById()`, you can delete it.

```php
$doc = (new Doc)->findById(1);
$doc->delete();
```

You can also bulk delete items.

```php
(new Doc)->delete([1,2,3]);
```

## Count

You can run the `count()` method on a model to get the number of items.

```php
$number = $doc->findAll()->count();
```

## Select
 
You can use the `select()` method to return specific columns only.

```php
$doc = (new Doc)->select('id', 'title')->first();
```

## Get ID and Set Primary Key 

The ID column is not always `id`. To access the primary key column, use the `getID()` method. For example, in a model called `Member` the primary key might be the user's email address.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use App\Results\Docs;
use TypeRocket\Models\Model;

class Member extends Model
{
    protected $resource = 'members';
    protected $idColumn = 'email';
}
```

Then,

```php
$email = (new Member)->first()->getID();
```

## Router Injection

If you are using custom routes and using controller injection, you can set the automatic router injection column to something other than the primary ID by defining the `getDependencyInjectionKey()` method in the model class.
```php
class Doc extends Model
{
    // ...

    public function getDependencyInjectionKey()    {
        return 'slug';
    }
}
```

For the custom route,

```php
// routes.php
tr_route()->get()->on('docs/*', 'show@Doc');
```

Using the `DocController` method `slug`,

```php
<?php
namespace App\Controllers;

use TypeRocket\Controllers\Controller;

class DocController extends Controller
{
    function show( \App\Models\Doc $doc) {
        return tr_view('docs.view', compact('doc'))->setTitle($doc->title);
    }
}
```

## Relationships

If you want to assign relationships to models [view the relationships documentation](/docs/v1/relationships/).

## Accessors

You can now implement [Laravel-style accessors](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators) on models.

```php
use \TypeRocket\Utility\Sanitize;

class Doc extends Model
{
    // ...

    public function getSlugProperty()
    {
        return Sanitize::dash($this->name);
    }
}
```

You now have access to a `slug` property on the `Doc` model.

```php
$doc = new Doc;
echo $doc->slug;
```

To understand how this works, have a look at the `mutateProperty` function on the `Model` class:

```php
protected function mutateProperty($key, $value)
{
    return $this->{'get'.Str::camelize($key).'Property'}($value);
}
```

You can see that the bit between `get` and `Property` becomes the property name. Within the function, the property is Pascal case. When getting the value, the property is a snake case. So `$doc->getTheThingProperty()` becomes `$doc->the_thing`. This allows you to mutate values from the database on retrieval, cleans up your constructors and property declarations, and removes the need to keep calling getter methods with long names

## With: Eager Loading

You can eager load related models associated with a model using the `with()` method. With method takes a single `string` argument. The `string` value must be the method name used for the model's relationship.

For example, the `Post` model might have this relationship method:

```php
public function meta() {
    return $this->hasMany( WPPostMeta::class, 'post_id' );
}
```

You could eager load the associated `WPPostMeta` models using the `meta()` method by passing a string of `'meta'` to the `with()` method of the `Post` model before getting the results.

```php
(new \App\Models\Post)->with('meta')->findById(1);
(new \App\Models\Post)->published()->with('meta')->get();
```

You can also use dot syntax to eager load deeply into your models using the same pattern. For example, say we have a model named `MyCustomModel` and it has an `author` relationship and the `author` has a `posts` relationship. You can deeply eager load by passing the string `'author.posts'` to the `with()` method of the `MyCustomModel` model.

```php
(new \App\Models\MyCustomModel)->with('author.posts')->findById(1);
```

### Multiple Relationships

You can eager load multiple relationships by passing an array to the `with` method.

```php
(new \App\Models\MyCustomModel)
    ->with(['author.posts', 'author.videos', 'location'])
    ->findById(1);
```

### Scoping

You can scope eager loaded relationships by passing a callable to the `with` method using an array and the key as the relationship name.

```php
$pages = (new App\Models\Page)
    ->published()
    ->with(['meta' => function($query) {
        return $query->where('meta_key', 'feature');
    }])
    ->get();
```

Limiting the number of items eager loaded is not yet possible. If you need this feature, you can [create your own eager loading system](https://kevdees.com/raw-php-and-mysql-eager-loading/) until WordPress adds support for MySQL 8.

*Note: You can not limit the number of items on eager loaded relationships using `take` or another method. MySQL 8 has support for `ROW_NUMBER` which would make this possible, but WordPress does not support MySQL 8.*

## toArray and toJson

Convert a model to an `array` or `json`.

```php
$model->toArray();
$model->toJson();
```

### Importing Relationshsips

When using eager loading, `toArray()` and `toJson` will also import the loaded relationships as a part of the return value.

```php
$machines = (new \App\Models\Manufacturer)
    ->with([
        'machines.machineType',
        'machines.industryType',
        'machines.machineConfiguration'
        ])
    ->findById(1)->get();

$machines->toArray();
$machines->toJson();
```

## Post Type Models

At times will want to access the `WP_Post` object using a `WPPost` model without making an extra query to the database. You can now do this using the `WP_Post()` method on any post type model.

Here is an advanced usage example on how this can be used to optimize your database performance.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Models;

use TypeRocket\Models\WPPost;

class Symbol extends WPPost
{
    protected $postType = 'post';

    public function getLinkProperty()
    {
        return get_the_permalink($this->WP_Post());
    }

    public function getFeaturedImageProperty()
    {
        $id = !empty($this->meta->_thumbnail_id) ? $this->meta->_thumbnail_id : 0;

        return wp_get_attachment_image($id);
    }

}
```

On the Frontend:

```php
<?php
$symbol_model = new \App\Models\Symbol;

/**
 * Meta is eager loaded and post meta cache is updated.
 */
$symbols = $symbol_model->with('meta')->published()->whereMeta('highlight', '=', '1')->get();
?>

<?php if($symbols) : foreach ($symbols as $symbol) :
    /**
     * Using accessors the permalink and featured image are loaded
     * without overly querying the database.
     */
    ?>
    <a class="col-3" href="<?= $symbol->link; ?>">
        <?= $symbol->featured_image; ?>
    </a>
<?php endforeach; endif; ?>
```

## Pagination

```php
$per_page = 25;
$get_page = 1;
$pager = $model->paginate($per_page, $get_page);
```

Pagination results in object methods.

```php
$pager->getResults();
$pager->getCount();
$pager->getCurrentPage();
$pager->getNumberPerPage();
$pager->getNumberOfPages();
$pager->getNextPage();
$pager->getPreviousPage();
$pager->getLastPage();
$pager->getFirstPage();
$pager->getLinks();
$pager->toArray();
$pager->toJson();
```

```php
echo $pager;
// Outputs JSON format
```
