Title: Install With Composer
Description: Installing TypeRocket Pro with Composer

---


## Requirements

Before getting started, be sure your setup supports [the TypeRocket Pro system and browser requirements](/docs/v1/requirements).

**Important**: Pro users with a Plus or Max license will have access to composer. Single site licenses do not have composer access.

## Licensing & Use

Before installing TypeRocket using composer, [be aware of the licensing restrictions and our advice on how TypeRocket should be used](https://typerocket.com/how-to-use-and-install-typerocket/).

## Install TypeRocket Pro with Composer

To install TypeRocket Pro using composer, first [download composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and install it globally. You can [read the full instructions on the composer.org website](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

**Important**: Composer `1.10.0+` is required. If you do not have the latest version of Composer you can update using the command `composer selfupdate --stable`.

### 1. Authenticate

Enable access to the TypeRocket composer repository by authenticating your server or development computer with `typerocket.repo.packagist.com` using your "Composer Token". You can access your token from [your TypeRocket account](https://typerocket.com/account/).

Authenticate composer by replacing the text `YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE` from the following command with your token. From the command line run:

```
composer config --global --auth http-basic.typerocket.repo.packagist.com token YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
```

*Note: Token authentication is required only once per machine or server.*

### 2. Installation Types

There are two recommended ways to download and install TypeRocket Pro using composer:

1. WordPress MU Plugin install.
2. Root install.

For beginners, the MU install is the fittest place to start.

*Note: Only one installation type is required for TypeRocket to work. Either the theme install or the root install. Also, you should not install TypeRocket into an existing plugin or theme.*

### 2.1 MU Install

From the command line, go to your `wordpress/wp-content/mu-plugins` folder. Then, replace `YOUR_URL_HERE` in the following command with the "Composer URL" from your acount page and run it:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist typerocket/pro typerocket --add-repository --repository=YOUR_URL_HERE
```

Finally, in the root of your [WordPress MU plugins folder](https://wordpress.org/support/article/must-use-plugins/) create a PHP file named `typerocket.php` and add the following.

```php
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: TypeRocket Pro MU  
Description: MU plugin installation.  
Author: TypeRocket  
Version: 1  
Author URI: http://typerocket.com  
*/
define('TR_MU_INSTALL', '/typerocket/wordpress/');  
require ('typerocket/init.php');
```

### 2.2 Root Install

*Note: You do not need to install WordPress before doing a root install.*

To install TypeRocket as your root application, create the TypeRocket Pro project in a new location run from the command line. Replace `YOUR_URL_HERE` in the following command with the "Composer URL" from your account page and run it:

```
composer create-project --prefer-dist typerocket/pro typerocket --add-repository --repository=YOUR_URL_HERE
cd typerocket
```

Next, use the TypeRocket Galaxy CLI `root:install` command to install WordPress and start your project:

```bash
php galaxy root:install {database} {db_username} {db_password}
```

TypeRocket root install is now complete. You can access the WordPress files from the `typerocket/wordpress` folder. Finally, Complete the WordPress installation by pointing your servers root web folder to the `typerocket/wordpress` and then visit your site's web address.

#### PHP Server

Optionally, if you do not have a web server configured, you can use the built-in TypeRocket PHP server on your local machine to view your WordPress site. From the command line, navigate to the `typerocket/wordpress` folder and run the following command:

```
php -S localhost:8888 ../server.php
```

In your browser, visit `localhost:8888` to view the WordPress install page.

#### What Root Install Does

Running `root:install` will:

- Downloads WordPress in the `wordpress` folder where the assets are located.
- Creates the `wp-config.php` file in the main TypeRocket folder.
- Enables TypeRocket's root theme and removes all WordPress themes.
- Installs TypeRocket MU plugin allowing for theme URL overrides.
- Add `require __DIR__ . '/init.php';` to your `wp-config.php`.

#### Deploying A Root Install

When pushing your code to a production server, ensure that you have the correct `wp-config.php` settings, the MU TypeRocket WordPress plugin, and the correct TypeRocket configuration.

Note, when rooting TypeRocket `wp-config.php` is modified and `init.php` is required after the `ABSPATH` is defined. This is important to note because you need to require the `init.php` in `wp-config.php` for production and not just development.

```php
/** Absolute path to the WordPress directory. */
if ( !defined('ABSPATH') )
    define('ABSPATH', dirname(__FILE__) . '/');

require __DIR__ . '/init.php'; // Include TypeRocket

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once(ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php');
```

## Updating

To update TypeRocket run `composer update`. This will update all the PHP code and JS/CSS assets.
